  - Mobile: 1 column
  - Tablet: 2 columns
  - Desktop: 3 columns
  - Large Desktop: 4 columns
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Real-time performance metrics (FPS, render time, memory usage)
  - Lazy loading of images with blur effect
  - Component memoization for reduced re-renders
  - Virtualized scrolling for handling large datasets
- **Modern UI/UX**:
  - Material UI components
  - Smooth hover animations
  - Responsive layout
  - Clean and intuitive interface
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Product filtering system
  - Store distance indicators
  - Rating system
  - Real-time WebSocket simulation for live updates
